# BlackVersion: 10.99 (Retsugen-devel): I'm playing in Monte Carlo. When we both pass, I will consider all the stones on the board alive. If you are reading this, write 'yes'. Please bear with me at the game end, I need to fill the whole board; if you help me, we will both be happier. Filling the board will not lose points (NZ rules). Have a nice game!
